Hey there!
this is a racing game made by me so this game starts with a entry field which asks for your name and when you click the play button a display screen will be shown which will say
"Hello! [your name]" . After there are 4 people ready to play the game starts and you just have to press the UP ARROW KEY in order to move forward once you reach the end line and you car stops moving you may press "ctrl+shift+i" key to check your rank.
